# Computer Vision Challenge: Preprocessing & Evaluation

During my Le Wagon Data Science & AI bootcamp, I worked on a computer vision project that sparked my interest in the field. To deepen my skills, I sought out online practice challenges and datasets inspired by real-world applications like vehicle detection and satellite imagery analysis. This repository contains two exercises I completed to explore preprocessing and model evaluation, showcasing my solutions and development process.

## Exercises
1. **[Axle Tree Merging](./1_axle_tree_merger/README_1.md):** Preprocessing vehicle axle annotations by merging nearby single axles.
   - Code: `merge_axle_tree.py`
   - Notebook: `axle_tree2.ipynb`

2. **[Airplane Detector Evaluation](./2_performance_evaluation_precision_accuracy/README_2.md):** Assessing a detector’s performance with IoU, precision, and recall metrics.
   - Code: `evaluate_perf.py`
   - Notebook: `task3.ipynb`

## Setup
1. Clone the repo: `git clone https://github.com/tuusuario/ComputerVision-Challenge.git`
2. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt` (includes `shapely`, `jupyter`).
3. Dive into each exercise folder for details and execution instructions.

## Purpose
These exercises helped me master key computer vision concepts—data transformation, geometric analysis, and optimization—while documenting my learning journey.
